(attachment removed to protect patient identity). but yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils). the tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which i guess, in you, must be slightly big. the pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection. now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not corona). they usually get better with time and supportive treatment. traditional indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. tea makes a good addition i guess. sudafed and zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully. now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. in such cases promptly revert to me. you may need a z pack then.\npatient: thank you doctor, as of now 12:40 pm i am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. i only ate some breakfast and drank water. here is my story: before feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick. friday february 28th - i woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. hours later was better. saturday february 29th - diarrhea sunday march 1st - diarrhea monday march 2 - diarrhea tuesday march 3 - diarrhea wednesday march 4 - no stool thursday march 3 - no more diarrhea friday march 4th - monday march 9th - no issues monday march 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really. sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat afternoon i ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later i drank cough and flu medicine. on monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 am, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and i described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like gerd, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. he asked have you tried stronger antacids like pepcid or zantac? i said no. then doctor asked me to try pepcid and tell me how it goes. tuesday and wednesday march 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day. wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine. thursday march 21 i woke up fine, then once ate pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then i counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when i counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. then shortly after, i drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. my heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that. friday march 20- 10 am i woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus. 15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder. 11 am - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual. 11:30 am moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed. 11:58 am - feeling a bit better 12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual. after an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.\ndoctor: hello, always protonix is better than zantac. try using protonix (pantoprazole). do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. do not drink a lot of water after a meal. avoid spicy and oily foods.\npatient: thank you doctor, i went to the store to look for zantac they did not have it, so i talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since pepcid and zantac are the same. he said to try ranitidine. right now i tried pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes i think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, i tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. then i think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. even water makes my heart beat a little faster. should i stick with pepcid? finish the entire bottle? i think it has 20-30 pieces. i used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like i get hungry before i go to bed then i started eating snacks and lying down. sometimes i starve myself. sometimes i wake up with acid feeling in my mouth. i don't know why i woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like i had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). i then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, i started to breathe better again. could it be shortness or breath? may be blood pressure? esophagus issue? chest issue? heart issue? i am having weird breathing. should i be worried?\ndoctor: hi, you need to take pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. avoid heavy meals. the issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. it does not appear sinister.\npatient: thank you doctor, i was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. i was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.\ndoctor: hi, do not worry about it. drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. eat well cooked meats.\npatient: thank you doctor, i really appreciate your help so much. i appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. only thing i am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. i will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. i hope to get less chest issues when i wake up.\ndoctor: hi, do not worry so much. you will be absolutely alright. give it some time. if you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. do you eat healthy food and do exercises?\npatient: yeah if it doesn't get better laryngoscopy would be perfect. okay, i'll give it some time thank you! i try to eat vegetables and fruits. i don't eat much junk food that much. i used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc... exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. i have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. used to a lot years ago, now barely. since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. after this point high school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. when i was younger (elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through. one doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it. so, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.that's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.\ndoctor: i guess you are in the right track. with regards to food diet and exercise. restart doing your exercise. keep yourself active. try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. that way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.\npatient: sounds good! awesome! appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. very patient and kind!\n\nReturn only the JSON object."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"conditions\": [{\"name\": \"chills\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"last night i was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual\"}, {\"name\": \"lightheadedness\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"feeling lightheaded and a lot of burping\"}, {\"name\": \"burping\", \"status\": \"active\", \"onset\": \"at least two years\", \"evidence\": \"the burping issue was going on for at least two years\"}, {\"name\": \"sore throat\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"i have minor coughs and sore throat\"}, {\"name\": \"enlarged tonsils\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils)\"}, {\"name\": \"breathing problems\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"felt like could not breathe\"}, {\"name\": \"diarrhea\", \"status\": \"resolved\", \"onset\": \"February 28th to March 4th\", \"evidence\": \"friday february 28th - i woke up feeling unwell... diarrhea\"}, {\"name\": \"heart rate increase\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"my heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that\"}, {\"name\": \"chest pain\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"i woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach)\"}, {\"name\": \"acid reflux\", \"status\": \"suspected\", \"evidence\": \"does sound like gerd\"}, {\"name\": \"anxiety\", \"status\": \"active\", \"evidence\": \"i think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something\"}, {\"name\": \"esophagus issue\", \"status\": \"suspected\", \"evidence\": \"could it be shortness or breath?
